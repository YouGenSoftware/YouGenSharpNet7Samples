# Introduction
This solution contains projects that have been generated using tooling licensed by [YouGen Software, LLC](https://yougensoft.com). These projects are intended to be used by technology professionals as a highly robust bootstrap ecosystem with the following nonexhaustive list of primary use-cases:
* Rapid platforming/re-platforming/modernizing of database-centric, web-scale software ecosystems
* Platform implementing using principles of [Clean Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/common-web-application-architectures)
* Provisioning modular workflows for high testability and automation plugability
* Setting team-wide, strategic architecture and development standards
* Unifying solution platforms and consolidating costs and efforts under a fully DotNet ecosystem
* Annihilating proof-of-concept development timelines
* Reducing bugs and defects
* Increasing strategic team coding cohesiveness and opinionating stylistic preferences
* Upskilling dev teams through robust, fully-functional, instantly runnable coded solutions
* Supercharging ongoing dev team productivity through eliminating time spent on scaffolding, prototyping, and CRUD coding
* Refocusing creative technology professionals on core, proprietary, valuable business logic creation
* Reducing multiplicity of user interface development costs costs through [Blazor Webassembly](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore) driven, unified Web/Mobile/Desktop development platform with maximum code reuse.
